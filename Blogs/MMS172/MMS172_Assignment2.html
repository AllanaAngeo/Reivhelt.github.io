		<h2>MMS172 Midpoint Blog</h2><br>
		<p>Compared to last year I was not as excited about Audio in Multimedia in this term. My grade from last year has really affected me, and my primary focus in my third year was getting a passing mark for this class so I can move forward to other MMS production classes. This is why I am not very participative in the discussion forums. I have already read and experienced the lessons and bonus forums, but I have little motivation to go beyond the required assignments. I am relieved though when I saw the course outline and it's the same as last year.</p>
		<p>I mentioned in my last year's midpoint blog that I "am not ready to shell out thousands of pesos for audio equipment that I won't be using regularly," and that statement just hit harder in our situation right now. Earlier this year we moved to a different house and my parents bought a tablet for me to work on my requirements. It has way better specs than my laptop back then (it is very easy to find something better than my laptop it had one point something hertz in processing power and 4GB RAM).</p>
		<p>I am very grateful for the investment since it provided me a better experience when doing my requirements sinc now I don't have to wait for atleast a few minutes every button click on the laptop now. It also motivated me to do more in my obligations since now I can get to work quickly when something urgent comes up. Hence why I kind of deflated a little bit when I saw in one of the forums that the use of mobile devices is very discouraged compared to PCs and laptops.</p>
		<p>I have already moved my necessary files from the laptop and started fresh on my tablet, so that would mean I have to install Audacity in my laptop again. It is very demotivating, but I am very grateful that Audacity is not that heavy of a software since it has not slowed down the device not even once. My objective remains the same though I have to figure our how to record my audio in the laptop with good volume.</p>
		<p>As for Assignment 1, I am sort of relieved not only that it does not have any intimate personal experience unlike last year (my biggest mistake), but also there are little feminine voice roles in the audio storytelling so I can ease up on recording my voice because yes I still do not like my voice. However, that would mean that I will have to look for people who would do the other roles, and I already have other people in mind. They may not exactly fit the characteristics of the characters that will have voice lines, but editing the audio a tiny bit is allowed so I can give the impression that the voices are younger or older than the voice actors! The concern is how, and I'm still researching on it, along with other things to prepare for the project.</p>
		<p>Aside from the given challenges for the project, compared to last year we are working within a shorter time frame due to recent typhoons. Nonetheless I think I can finish the output in that time. I think I just feel sort of sad since my blunder has affected me too much and I can't enjoy this class. Aside from that whenever I think of what I'm going to do and what I will be excited about for the project, all I think about is the audio mixing and editing parts. Similar to tuning voice audios with Vocaloid or UTAU voicebanks, I find that process more enjoyable than recording audio. Though I understand that it is imporant to experience and understand the nitty gritty aspect of audio, the first hurdle is really intimidating. I will still do my best to at least pass this class, primarily because I need to not exceed four years in college.</p>
