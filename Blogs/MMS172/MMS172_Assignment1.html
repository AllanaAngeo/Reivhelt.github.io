		<h2>Project Concept Statement</h2><br>
		<h2>Storytelling Audiobook</h2>
		<p>After a year of flopping MMS172 last year I'm going to have to take a safer route (again). Last year was a mess because aside from the fact that I procrastinated (yikes), an unfortunate event has happened which lead to an involuntary family reunion, and I *cannot* record those lines from my short story which included (glaring) hints of LGBT themes.
		</p>
		<p>For this project I'd like to do a short audiobook of "The Little Prince", specifically BAE Jin Soo's very short and nuanced version of the book which can be read in his webtoon "Friday: Forbidden Tales". I had a hard time last year since I do not know how to exactly do things or what a good combination of sounds sounds like, so if I were to use The Little Prince as a basis I can use the movie as a guide. Aside from that, BAE Jin Soo's version is short but also altered to fit the referenced Sewol ferry tragedy. It is a great webcomic chapter that allows the reader to view the characters and planets in a different way once the got to the bottom of the chapter and read about the sinking of the Sewol ferry in the comments. After reading the webcomic I thought covering the whole thing in the audio book will be difficult since it is too long, and I'd like to focus on the alterations the author did to the story, so I might have to start the audiobook from the point where the little prince decides to leave his planet</p><br><br>
		<h2>Project Plan</h2><br>
		<h2>Schedule</h2>
		<img src="../../WebsiteAssets/Schedule.jpg" style="width: 400px; object-fit: contain;">
		<p>During the research period, I will be researching more about what goes into recording an audiobook or similar outputs. I aim to study during that week how to effectively tell a story with a vivid illustration of the environment or settings without the sound effects overpowering the story narration. I will also have to research how to manipulate audio clips to distort them and highlight the severity of the situation in the story. My aim here is to figure out a way to highlight the referenced incident in the snippet of the short story.</p>
		<p>In determining and arranging samples, I will be listing the kind of sounds I will need to record or recreate for the audiobook while also arranging those sounds in the timeline of the audio story. Recording the length of the narration and the dialogues may help a lot to figure out the timing and arrangement of the sounds in the background.</p>
		<p>It is pretty much self-explanatory in recording, mixing, & editing. I will be recording the needed material I listed from the previous period. Around the same time I will be mixing and editing the audio clips as well. I assigned the recording and the mixing to be around the same time because I predict I will be going back and forth from recording (or re-recording) and mixing audio clips.</p>
		<p>Lastly, aside from the submission for the class requirement, I will upload the output here in my personal website. After some time has passed I will archive these blog posts and move the output somewhere else in the site (probably will create a new option in the navigation menu like "Projects"</p><br><br>
		<h2>Logistics</h2><br>
		<h2>Hardware, Software, & Signal Flow</h2>

		<h2>Location</h2>
		<p>Circumstances have changed and my family and I moved to a different place. However similar things apply as last time where I will record in our (me and my sister's) room. Aside from that since there are scenes where the little prince will fly towards different planets I am hoping I can get the chance to record some wind or bird wings flapping. Fortunately our house does not have plenty of neighbors nearby so it might be possible to record those sounds without bothering anyone.</p>
		<h2>Things to Note (in my head)</h2>
		<p>Since I plan to emphasize the sunken ferry incident it would be impossible to record some sounds like ocean water splashing so I plan to use some pre-recorded audio tracks for the ambience and some sound effects, but nonetheless I'll be able to record majority of the audio clips by myself.</p>
