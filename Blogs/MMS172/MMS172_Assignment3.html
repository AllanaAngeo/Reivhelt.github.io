		<p>In this audio project I was not able to find other people who are willing to voice act for my output, so I had to make do and record all the parts myself (however awkward it may be). I also had to change the software to use for this project from Audacity to N-track Studio because my previous laptop has retired without my consent. Because of the difference between the two softwares I needed to make sure I only use the functionalities that I can manually adjust myself.</p>
		<p>Because I already have a source material, dividing the parts of the audio project was easier. I divided it into the narration, the dialogues of the traveler, the little prince, the businessman, the man waiting by the mailbox, the arguing businessmen, the king, and the other adults. I rearranged the timing of the audio clips and used it as the basis to know how long I will record some of the sound effects.</p>
		<p>For the sound effects I recorded the sound of stepping on the sand, metal clanking sound effects, and footsteps. I don't live anywhere with sand or gravel available (except during the time where there were people building a house nearby), so I decided on recording the sound of the sand by using grains of uncooked rice! The sound of falling grains of sand compared to rice is distinct, but if it is simply pressing and slightly moving around the grains of rice it is very passable. For the sound of metal clanking I tinkered around my dad's tools and spare metal parts kept behind our house, and for the foot steps it was simple enough. After that I rearranged them again with the voice recordings</p>
		<p>I added the noise gate effect on the voice recordings to cut out the small noises picked up. I also added a slight reverb for the dialogue and narration to not sound too crispy like clean voice recordings. The settings of the reverb between the narration and the dialogue are slightly different with the narration having a slightly noticeable reverb to make it distinct from the dialogues.</p>
		<p>I then added and spliced the pre-recorded ambience music to time it with the certain parts of the story I have also changed them accordingly to fit with the scenes:</p>
		<ul>
				<li><p>- added a pause and used a different part of the ambience music when the little prince makes a first appearance.</p></li>
				<li><p>- distinct music from his first appearance and the point where him and the narrator are more acquainted.</p></li>
				<li><p>- changed pitch of the busy businessman's ambience music by one semitone to make it less comfortable.</p></li>
				<li><p>- spliced and extended the arguing businessmen's ambience music.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>For other huge changes applied on certain voice recordings, I added an echo effect on the king's voice when he shouts out. I also duplicated the track then added a small chorus effect for the other adults near at the end of the audio project to mimic a crowd speaking at the same time.</p>
