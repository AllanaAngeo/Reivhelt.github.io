		<h2>Almost at the finish line</h2>
		<p>Compared to what happened last year I'm happy that I was able to finally finish my output for the final audio project, though evidently I still have a lot to learn. The place that I live in is louder compared to back then which I took for granted. I tried my best getting used to speaking for recording, doing exercises beforehand, speaking louder, but I don't think anything related to voice acting or recording is going to work out for me. That is not to say that I did not have fun at all when it comes to this project.</p>
				
		<p>The recording part is the hardest, humbling, and insecurity-inducing part of the process, but I enjoyed it when I start arranging and timing the audio clips (granted I have to hear my voice most of the time but still). It felt more natural to me to decide when to put the audio clips closer together to make it seem the dialogue is in a rush or when to put a pause between the dialogues. It was so fun when I ended up grains of uncooked rice in place of sand or gravel.</p>

		<p>However there were still plenty of mistakes. I was not able to accomplish what I intended back then which is to achieve better voice recordings. I tend to speak in a softer voice, so I ended up increasing the gain on the microphone when recording, which picked up plenty of unwanted sounds. It did not help that I'm in a different environment that is slightly more urban, with more cars passing by, house consruction ongoing, dogs barking, so some audio recordings picked up on that. Despite all that, the experience with the final project wasn't really all that bad.</p>

		<p>Another thing that I want to get myself over with is this feeling of inferiority over something I feel very insecure about, that I feel that I can't excel in multimedia if I'm not gonna do well with the sound medium. The more that I try to be open-minded, the more that I think that there must be students like me who really like to work with only a fraction of what multimedia encompasses. I applied in this program because I want to focus on graphics, illustration, animation, and possibly programming, but I'm not great on working with other mediums. There must be students who applied in BAMS because they want to explore more about audio and video, but also have a hard time using other modalities as well. I know that everyone has differences, but it would be embrassing to wallow in the insecurity over my voice when other students are eager to explore other things they haven't worked with yet.</p>

		<p>Working with audio was fun although it was very tiring. Checking the recorded clips always takes more time compared to working with visual art because of its nature. It would take a few seconds to check for things to adjust when it comes to visual art because the things is shown in its entirety when presented, unlike when working with audio where it flows through time.</p>
				
				<p>However I'd like to work with audio again in the future. I'd like to use it for animation where I enjoyed sequencing audio tracks, similar to how some of my high school classmates did in when they were preparing background music for the broadcasting team. I'll just don't have to record my own voice, which I think is a big regret of mine when I decided on how I would do my project during the pre-production. After doing the final project, I think I enjoyed figuring out how to make certain sounds using objects more than recording people, which I should have highlighted instead.</p>

		<p>I really want to pass this time. Despite being able to enjoy the process and engaging with audio more than I did last year, I don't think I can do this again. I want to be able to explore other unfamiliar mediums at my own pace. I know that this course is a wonderful opportunity but I don't think I can do another like this where I'm pressured by a prerequisite course. I'll stick to what I know I'm good at for now and do my best to pass and graduate within 4 years of college. </p>
